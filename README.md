# Hompage
My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

## Version 0
In the first version of our page, we created a template resume for Donald Trump. This helped us organize the work, build the framework of our repository and try to work with layout.

## Version 1.0

In the second release of our project, we implemented many new features:
- we have prepared completely new texts
- worked on our image which wasn’t in the zero version
- worked on the design of all the blocks
- eliminated a lot of bugs
- made three language versions for our summary

## Version 2.0
In this release, I tried to correct errors of previous releases, correct the text and add new functionality:
- fixed text translations (as far as I could)
- added photo gallery
- fixed links in languages
- redid the display of the block of skills
- fixed html and css validation errors 

This is beautiful!
